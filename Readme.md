# Theme-1 - Detection and evaluation of the following elements on street imagery taken from a moving vehicle

Since visual pollution is a relatively recent issue compared to other forms of environmental contamination, study is needed to define, formalize, measure, and evaluate it from many angles. This competition aims to establish a new field of automated visual pollution classification, utilizing the technological prowess of the twenty-first century for environmental management applications.
By training and testing approaches to convolutional neural networks, we expect competitors to simulate the human learning experience in the context of picture identification for the classification of visual pollutants.
Additionally this will be useful for the development of a "visual pollution score/index" for urban areas that might produce a new "metric" or "indicator" in the discipline of urban environmental management.
In this competition, you will build and optimize algorithms based on a large-scale dataset. This dataset features the raw sensor camera inputs as perceived by a fleet of multiple vehicles in arestricted geographic area in KSA
If successful, youâ€™ll make a significant contribution towards stimulating further development city planning and empowering communities around the world.

# Theme 2- Pothole severity classification via computer vision

The majority of current pavement condition assessment techniques are labor-intensive and manual. Existing techniques for identifying and evaluating potholes rely on 3D surface reconstruction, which is expensive in terms of both hardware and compute, or on acceleration data, which only yields preliminary results. We are looking for teams to propose a low-cost method for automatically identifying potholes and judging their severity using vision-based data for both 2D and 3D reconstruction.
Utilizing the visual and spatial qualities of potholes as well as the measurement parameters (width, quantity, and depth) that are used to estimate pothole severity, we would like tounderstand how both 2D and 3D reconstruction can be combined to improve recognition results. While the width and depth of the potholes are determined using 3D reconstruction, the number and location of potholes is determined using 2D recognition.
Data gathering, distress identification and classification, and distress evaluation are the three steps in the pavement assessment process. Modern data collection techniques are being quickly replaced by inspection vehicles. These inspection vehicles can gather data at speeds of up to 60 mph (96 km/h), thanks to their numerous sensors, which include cameras for surface imaging, optical sensors for distance measurement, laser scanners for profiling, ultrasonic sensors for rutting detection, and accelerometers for roughness measurements. The second and third processes of distress classification and assessment are still mostly manual despite the automation of the data collection procedure. Currently, technicians manually examine the collected data to determine the existence of distresses and gauge their severity from the computer screen. Such a labor-intensive manual method might become unsystematic due to the volume of data that needs to be collected, which eventually lowers the assessment's quality.
Although there are clear rules for manual diagnosis and assessment of asphalt distress, the technicians' experience affects the assessment's outcome. A hybrid imaging device that combines digital cameras and infrared lasers to capture continuous images of lines projected by infrared lasers is based on 3D surface profiles from time-of-flight laser scanners to classify and quantify pavement deterioration. These commercial software programs do not, however, count or identify all the potholes that have been spotted.
